# start simple server on android phone
lldb-server platform --listen 0.0.0.0:12345

adb forward tcp:54321 tcp:12345


(lldb)
platform connect connect://localhost:54321



# there is a prebuilt gdbserver and gdb client in the ndk's which work 
out of the box, so why bothering with lldb?

# on device
./gdbserver --remote-debug --attach 0.0.0.0:12345 <pid>

# on host
adb forward tcp:54321 tcp:12345

#on host
./gdb
target remote localhost:54321

-> start gdb in a new window as I did with r2 and pwntools
